Build Failure Analysis
======================

Error Message:
--------------
ninja: error: manifest 'build.ninja' still dirty after 100 tries

Cause:
------
This error indicates that the build system (Ninja) detects that the build definition files are changing *during* the build process. This prevents it from establishing a stable build plan.

Common Causes:
1.  **Corrupted Build Cache**: The `.cxx` directory (C++ build cache) is in an inconsistent state.
2.  **File Synchronization**: Tools like OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive syncing the build folder can change file timestamps or lock files.
3.  **Antivirus Interference**: Real-time scanning might modify or lock files momentarily.
4.  **Clock/Timestamp Issues**: Files with timestamps in the future (though we checked for this and didn't find any).
5.  **NDK/CMake Mismatch**: Incompatible versions of NDK or CMake.

Resolution Plan:
----------------
1.  **Deep Clean**: Manually delete all build artifacts:
    - android/.gradle
    - android/.cxx
    - android/app/build
    - android/build
2.  **Reinstall Dependencies**: Remove and reinstall `node_modules` to ensure clean native module linking.
3.  **Rebuild**: Run `./gradlew assembleRelease` again from a clean state.
